This algorithm detects cyclonic and anticyclonic supercells based on provided thunderstorm contours in a Cartesian framework, and Doppler velocity data in polar coordinates. The resulting objects are returned as a point-based object in a json file.
The script realtime_parallel executes a single timestep of mesocyclone detection, using parallel computation. realtime_serial uses serial computation and takes significantly longer. To obtain timeseries of results, the realtime script needs to be called for every desired timestep.
The script realtime_plot provides a visualization of a single timestep. In addition, daily_plot provides a daily summary (based on the date format of the files).
script.sh provides an example, how to call the functions.
The folder "library" contains all internal functions of the algorithm. "mask_data" contains the lookup tables for the Swiss radar network to speed up coordinate transformations.
